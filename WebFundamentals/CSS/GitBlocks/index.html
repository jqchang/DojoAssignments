          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a version control Systen; you can think Of it as a series Of snapshots (Cllwnits) Of your code base.
              With the creation Of each you build out a whole application, seeing
              the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment
              and back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the you r app.</p>
          <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
            It lets you and others together on projects frÂ«n anywhere using those code
             snapshots that you took development.</p>
