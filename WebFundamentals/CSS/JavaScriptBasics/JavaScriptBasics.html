        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
          lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
          environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
          a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="code">var x;</span></li>
          <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="code">var x = 10;</span></li>
          <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variable you need to know the data type. There are six data types
            that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean - <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false;</span> <span class="code">text</span></li>
